## [Application Development Projects](https://github.com/w1nterb1rd/Application-Development)

 These are some of the Web Application Development projects I did using Python, Flask, Vue, SQLite.
 
 * Library Management System - Digital Library management, add sections and e-books, issue/return books, get reporting and daily reminders, view stats on dashboard
 * BlogLite App - User and profile management, post blogs, read and rate blogs, follow other bloggers.
 * Flask Vue CRUD App - A basic CRUD application to learn Flask and Vue frameworks

## [Machine Learning Project: Taxi Fare Prediction](https://github.com/w1ndwatcher/Machine-Learning/blob/main/21f1006327-notebook-t32023.ipynb)

<p align=justify>Taxi Fare Prediction: The data was taken from Kaggle. Supervised Machine Learning was performed to predict the taxi-fare based on variables like vendor ID, passenger count, pickup and drop-off time, location ID etc. In this project, I have done data cleanup and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, encoding, scaling, training the model and checking the accuracy.</p>
 
## [Data Science Project: Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/w1nterb1rd/Heart-Disease-Prediction)

<p align=justify>The data was taken from Kaggle. Based on age, gender and symptoms of a person, the model predicts if that person is likely to have a heart attack or not. Since the dependent variable is categorical in nature, logistic regression model has been used. In this project, I have done step by step cleaning of data, treatment of outliers, dividing the data into test and train, modelling and accuracy check. Depending on the correlation between the independent variables, three models have been compared.</p>
